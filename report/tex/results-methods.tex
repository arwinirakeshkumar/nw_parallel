In the benchmarks results above, we focus on two paramers : the tile size and the numbers of processors. \\
For the openMP algorithm, we make use of one single node, and scale the numbers of processors from 2 to 16. \\
The MPI algorithm is run with 2,4,8 or 16 nodes, depending on the numbers of processors required. \\
All the results have been computed on the VLSCI Avoca server. It's important to note that our results have a lot of variance. During experimentations, we observed differents running time for the same parameters and inputs. The Avoca server can have performances that range from a scale of 1 to 10 (for instance : a program that runs in 0.7 seconds one day can run in 7s another day).\\
In order to have an idea of the performances of our parallel implementations, we have run a sequential algorithm on the same benchmark. \textbf{The timing of the sequential algorithm is 9.8s}.
\\
The benchmark is composed of two random sequences of size $2^{15}$.
