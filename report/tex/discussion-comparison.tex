The openMP results are quite close to the analysis. Indeed, the speed-up scores for a given number of cpus are comparable with the results found in part (3.2). \\
 The tile size does not seems to have such a great impact on the performances of both openMP and MPI versions of the algorithm. However, it is important to note that running the algorithm with a tile size lower than 64 gives poors performance. We have not included the results here because the program is running out of memory when the tile size is too little. \\
The performances of the MPI algorithm are way lower than what we could expect from the theoritical analysis. We will discuss this in the next part.
