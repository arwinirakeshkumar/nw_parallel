The Needleman-Wunch (NW) algorithm is designed for and used to align sequences in within bioinformatics. It is very closely related to the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment, and they share the approach of solving their respective problems by using dynamic programming. In this report, the NW algortihm will be optimized to work in a multiprocessor environment, this will be done using the two parallelization APIs: openMP and MPI.
